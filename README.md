## Description

  I created an interactive experience within the unity application. I worked with 3D models, colors and music to create something rather unique and entertaining. The entire project involves one central item that looks like an eye, that the user can control with an Xbox One Controller (as shown on the instruction picture). The camera is fixed, the only thing that the user can control is the radius of the middle circle and its position, whilst the whales spin on themselves rather simply and some particles fly away from the scene, which make the entire experience a bit uncommon and extraordinary.
The eye inthe middle is made by creating spheres and changing their radius as the inner circle moves and moving along tangents to create a smooth movement .

  To run this experience, all you should need to do is either clone the repo or download the zip file and open the project with Unity. You should also need an Xbox One Controller.

 ##Development Process
 
 I used Youtube tutorials a lot, as I am not very experienced with unity. I used examples from the lecture to make game objects spin on themselves and materials component. As you may, within the same project I tried a few things such as spawning elements and mesh generation, but I ended up not using them, because I didn't need it to achieve the final visual I wanted.

  ## Proudest Component
  I developed (with the help Youtube) this weird eye thing in the middle, and surprinsgly I kind of understand what I did, but to be completely honest, I am not very proud of this project.
  The eye thing works with 2 circles : 
    - An inner circle which can grow and shrink in size and move within the second circle.
    - An outter circle which limits the area and the maximal size of the generated spheres.
  It took me a certain amount of time to get the logic behind it, and I am quite surprised it worked.
  
  ## Youtube Time !

  ## Inspirations
  I have always been amazed by whales and their shapes and sounds, so I wanted to make something about it, and put the user as an static observer, trying to figure out what happens, being awkward and asking himself what this scenery means
